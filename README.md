[00:16.82] Go
[00:17.82] 
[00:32.34] Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm
[00:36.12] Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
[00:39.58] Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
[00:43.11] Catastrophic, not again
[00:54.61] 
[00:46.55] I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
[00:50.18] I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
[00:54.43] Catch me upon all your sordid little insurrections
[00:57.79] I've got no time to lose and I'm just caught up in all the cattle
[01:30.29] 
[01:01.95] Fray the strings
[01:03.86] Throw the shapes
[01:05.51] Hold your breath
[01:07.28] And listen
[01:12.28] 
[01:08.87] I am a world before I am a man
[01:12.59] I was a creature before I could stand
[01:15.81] I will remember before I forget
[01:20.50] Before I forget that
[01:30.50] 
[01:22.92] I am a world before I am a man
[01:26.49] I was a creature before I could stand
[01:30.06] I will remember before I forget
[01:34.72] Before I forget that
[01:44.72] 
[01:43.63] I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I
[01:47.35] I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
[01:51.40] Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
[01:54.71] I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up all the battles
[02:24.71] 
[01:59.14] Locked in clutch
[02:00.90] Pushed in place
[02:02.64] Hold your breath
[02:04.22] And listen
[02:09.22] 
[02:05.87] I am a world before I am a man
[02:09.42] I was a creature before I could stand
[02:12.63] I will remember before I forget
[02:17.32] Before I forget that
[02:27.32] 
[02:19.73] I am a world before I am a man
[02:23.41] I was a creature before I could stand
[02:26.94] I will remember before I forget
[02:31.19] Before I forget that
[02:41.19] 
[02:59.30] My end
[03:01.38] It justifies my means
[03:04.48] All I ever do is delay
[03:07.45] My every attempt to evade
[03:10.54] The other road in my head
[03:13.79] It justifies my means
[03:17.34] All I ever do is delay
[03:20.31] My every attempt to evade
[03:23.69] The end of the road
[03:33.19] 
[03:25.75] I am a world before I am a man
[03:29.02] I was a creature before I could stand
[03:32.22] I will remember before I forget
[03:36.74] Before I forget that
[03:46.74] 
[03:39.28] I am a world before I am a man
[03:42.74] I was a creature before I could stand
[03:46.18] I will remember before I forget
[03:50.34] Before I forget that
[04:00.34] 
[03:52.74] I am a world before I am a man
[03:56.29] I was a creature before I could stand
[03:59.49] I will remember before I forget
[04:03.75] Before I forget that
[04:13.75] 
[04:12.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[04:15.71] Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
